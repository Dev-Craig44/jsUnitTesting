To remove the submodule, I ran:

git submodule deinit -f javascript-testing-starter

So, here we go again...

## 🧪 What is Unit Testing?

Unit testing is the practice of writing **automated tests** that verify the correctness of individual functions or components in your codebase — without launching the full application or interacting with the UI.

---

### 🔄 Manual vs. Automated Testing

Traditionally, testing a function might involve:

1. Launching the app
2. Logging in
3. Navigating through the UI
4. Filling out a form
5. Submitting it
6. Verifying the result

That process is time-consuming and fragile. With **unit testing**, you skip all that and instead:

- Call the function **directly** in code
- Pass in different inputs
- Use a **test runner** to verify the expected output

This provides instant feedback via the terminal — ✅ green if it passes, ❌ red if it fails — and allows you to run **hundreds of tests in seconds**.

---

### 🧠 Why Unit Testing Matters

Once you build a suite of tests, you can run them **every time you make changes**. The benefits compound as your app grows.

#### ✅ 1. Catch Bugs Early

- Bugs found in the development phase are much cheaper to fix than bugs found in production.
- Studies show that post-deployment fixes can cost **5x more** than fixes caught during coding.

#### ✅ 2. Refactor with Confidence

- Refactoring = changing code structure without changing behavior.
- Tests act as safety nets: if something breaks, you'll know immediately.
- Example: Extracting repeated logic into a helper function.

#### ✅ 3. Think Through Edge Cases

- Writing tests forces you to think critically about error states, edge cases, and input variations.
- Result: more robust, reliable code.

#### ✅ 4. Living Documentation

- Unit tests show how a function is expected to behave.
- Other developers (or your future self) can understand the purpose of the code just by reading the tests.

---

### ⚖️ The Debate: How Much Testing Is Too Much?

You’ll meet people with extreme opinions:

- 🧔‍♂️ _John Smith_: _"I’ve written bug-free code for 20 years without a single unit test."_
- 🧑‍💻 _Test Smith_: _"Every line of code must be tested."_

Both are wrong.

#### 🧭 Be Pragmatic:

- No tests = fragile, slow manual testing.
- Testing every single line = costly, often unrealistic.
- Find a **balanced strategy** that fits the nature of your project.

### 🧠 When to Invest in Unit Testing

| Project Type                            | Test Coverage Strategy              |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 🚧 New Project w/ Evolving Requirements | Be light on tests — expect change   |
| 🏗️ Stable, Mature Codebase              | Invest in covering critical modules |
| 💼 Business-Critical Features           | Prioritize robust, trusted tests    |

> Unit testing is an investment. Like all investments, it can be wise or wasteful depending on how you do it.

---

### ⚠️ Poor Tests Are Worse Than No Tests

Bad tests can:

- Produce false positives or negatives
- Waste time during maintenance
- Block progress instead of guiding it

#### ✅ Good Tests Should Be:

- **Maintainable** – easy to update
- **Robust** – not fragile or overly specific
- **Trustworthy** – accurately reflect the intended behavior

If your tests don’t meet these criteria, they’ll slow you down instead of speeding you up.

---

## 🧪 Types of Tests

In automated testing, there are three primary types of tests:

---

### ✅ Unit Tests

- Test **individual units** of code (functions, classes, small modules) in **isolation**.
- Catch bugs **early** in the development process.
- Very **fast** to run and ideal for test-driven development.
- Example: Verifying a function correctly calculates a discount.

---

### 🔗 Integration Tests

- Test how **multiple components** work **together**.
- Help catch issues in **data flow**, **module communication**, and **component compatibility**.
- Slower than unit tests but essential for ensuring connected parts of the system cooperate correctly.
- Example: Testing a form component that depends on validation and a backend API response.

---

### 🌐 End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- Simulate **real user interaction** with the entire application.
- Test from the UI down to the backend and database.
- Provide **highest confidence** but are **slowest** to run.
- Example: Testing the complete sign-up flow including form submission and confirmation email.

---

## 📐 The Testing Pyramid

The classic advice for testing is to follow a **pyramid structure**:

- More unit tests (base)
- Fewer integration tests (middle)
- Even fewer end-to-end tests (tip)

> ⚠️ However, this is just a guideline — **not a rule**. Every project has different needs.

---

## 🧠 Key Insight

As you move **up the pyramid** (from unit → integration → E2E):

- **Speed decreases**
- **Confidence increases**

Use this trade-off to design a testing strategy that gives you the **most value** for your time and resources.

---

## 🎯 Strategy Advice

- Use **unit tests** for fast feedback while coding and refactoring.
- Use **integration tests** where units interact closely (e.g. services + UI).
- Use **E2E tests** sparingly to validate the full user experience.
- Don’t fall into extremes. There’s no universal formula.

> Like choosing between dress shoes and running shoes — it depends on where you're going.

## ⚙️ Setting Up Vitest

Easily add Vitest to your project in just a few steps:

---

### 📥 1. Install Vitest

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm i -D vitest
```

- The `-D` flag installs Vitest as a **development dependency**.
- This keeps your test tools out of your production bundle.

---

### 🛠️ 2. Add a Test Script

In your `package.json`, add the following to the `"scripts"` section:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "vitest"
}
```

---

### ▶️ 3. Run Your Tests

Now you can run your tests with:

```bash
npm test
# or
npm t
```

## 🧑‍🔬 Your First Test

Let's write your very first test!

1. **Create a file:**  
   In your project root, add a new file:  
   `test/intro.test.js`

> Vitest automatically detects files with `test` in their name.

---

### 🅰️🅰️🅰️ The AAA Pattern

Most tests follow the **AAA** pattern:

1. **Arrange** – Set up any necessary data or configuration.
2. **Act** – Perform the action you want to test.
3. **Assert** – Check that the outcome matches your expectations.

#### Example (Testing a TV Power Button):

- **Arrange:** The TV is turned on.
- **Act:** Press the power button.
- **Assert:** The TV should now be off.

# Code-First vs Test-First (TDD) — A Step-by-Step Walk-through

---

## 1. Two Ways to Write Tests

| Approach       | Sequence                                                         | Nickname                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Code First** | 1. Write application code → 2. Add tests afterward               | “What we’ve done so far”          |
| **Test First** | 1. Write tests → 2. Write just enough code to pass → 3. Refactor | **TDD = Test-Driven Development** |

---

## 2. TDD’s Three-Step Cycle

1. **Red** – Write a **failing** test.
2. **Green** – Write the **simplest code** that makes the test pass.
3. **Refactor** – Improve the design while keeping all tests green.
   - Loop back to step 1 and repeat.

---

## 3. TDD in Action – `calculateAverage()` Example

> Goal: create a function that returns the average of an array of numbers.

---

## 4. Benefits of TDD

- **100 % test coverage** for every execution path produced.
- **Prevents over-engineering** — you implement only what the failing test demands.
- **Continuous safety net** for fearless refactoring.

---

## 5. Real-World Caveats

- **Learning curve**: writing tests first feels awkward at first.
- **Complex domains**: crafting the very first test can be hard when requirements are fuzzy.
- **Not one-size-fits-all**: many teams happily adopt a hybrid (write-some-code, write-a-test) workflow.

---

## 6. Takeaways

- **TDD is a philosophy, not a religion.** Adopt when it boosts clarity and confidence; skip when it slows discovery.
- **Code First isn’t “wrong.”** If you prefer to prototype quickly and add tests afterward, that’s valid.
- **Experiment.** Practice TDD on small utilities (like `calculateAverage`) to build muscle memory before tackling large apps.
