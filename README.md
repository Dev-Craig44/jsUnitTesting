To remove the submodule, I ran:

## üß™ What is Unit Testing?

Unit testing is the practice of writing **automated tests** that verify the correctness of individual functions or components in your codebase ‚Äî without launching the full application or interacting with the UI.

---

### üîÑ Manual vs. Automated Testing

Traditionally, testing a function might involve:

1. Launching the app
2. Logging in
3. Navigating through the UI
4. Filling out a form
5. Submitting it
6. Verifying the result

That process is time-consuming and fragile. With **unit testing**, you skip all that and instead:

- Call the function **directly** in code
- Pass in different inputs
- Use a **test runner** to verify the expected output

This provides instant feedback via the terminal ‚Äî ‚úÖ green if it passes, ‚ùå red if it fails ‚Äî and allows you to run **hundreds of tests in seconds**.

---

### üß† Why Unit Testing Matters

Once you build a suite of tests, you can run them **every time you make changes**. The benefits compound as your app grows.

#### ‚úÖ 1. Catch Bugs Early

- Bugs found in the development phase are much cheaper to fix than bugs found in production.
- Studies show that post-deployment fixes can cost **5x more** than fixes caught during coding.

#### ‚úÖ 2. Refactor with Confidence

- Refactoring = changing code structure without changing behavior.
- Tests act as safety nets: if something breaks, you'll know immediately.
- Example: Extracting repeated logic into a helper function.

#### ‚úÖ 3. Think Through Edge Cases

- Writing tests forces you to think critically about error states, edge cases, and input variations.
- Result: more robust, reliable code.

#### ‚úÖ 4. Living Documentation

- Unit tests show how a function is expected to behave.
- Other developers (or your future self) can understand the purpose of the code just by reading the tests.

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è The Debate: How Much Testing Is Too Much?

You‚Äôll meet people with extreme opinions:

- üßî‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è _John Smith_: _"I‚Äôve written bug-free code for 20 years without a single unit test."_
- üßë‚Äçüíª _Test Smith_: _"Every line of code must be tested."_

Both are wrong.

#### üß≠ Be Pragmatic:

- No tests = fragile, slow manual testing.
- Testing every single line = costly, often unrealistic.
- Find a **balanced strategy** that fits the nature of your project.

### üß† When to Invest in Unit Testing

| Project Type                            | Test Coverage Strategy              |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| üöß New Project w/ Evolving Requirements | Be light on tests ‚Äî expect change   |
| üèóÔ∏è Stable, Mature Codebase              | Invest in covering critical modules |
| üíº Business-Critical Features           | Prioritize robust, trusted tests    |

> Unit testing is an investment. Like all investments, it can be wise or wasteful depending on how you do it.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Poor Tests Are Worse Than No Tests

Bad tests can:

- Produce false positives or negatives
- Waste time during maintenance
- Block progress instead of guiding it

#### ‚úÖ Good Tests Should Be:

- **Maintainable** ‚Äì easy to update
- **Robust** ‚Äì not fragile or overly specific
- **Trustworthy** ‚Äì accurately reflect the intended behavior

If your tests don‚Äôt meet these criteria, they‚Äôll slow you down instead of speeding you up.

---

## üß™ Types of Tests

In automated testing, there are three primary types of tests:

---

### ‚úÖ Unit Tests

- Test **individual units** of code (functions, classes, small modules) in **isolation**.
- Catch bugs **early** in the development process.
- Very **fast** to run and ideal for test-driven development.
- Example: Verifying a function correctly calculates a discount.

---

### üîó Integration Tests

- Test how **multiple components** work **together**.
- Help catch issues in **data flow**, **module communication**, and **component compatibility**.
- Slower than unit tests but essential for ensuring connected parts of the system cooperate correctly.
- Example: Testing a form component that depends on validation and a backend API response.

---

### üåê End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- Simulate **real user interaction** with the entire application.
- Test from the UI down to the backend and database.
- Provide **highest confidence** but are **slowest** to run.
- Example: Testing the complete sign-up flow including form submission and confirmation email.

---

## üìê The Testing Pyramid

The classic advice for testing is to follow a **pyramid structure**:

- More unit tests (base)
- Fewer integration tests (middle)
- Even fewer end-to-end tests (tip)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è However, this is just a guideline ‚Äî **not a rule**. Every project has different needs.

---

## üß† Key Insight

As you move **up the pyramid** (from unit ‚Üí integration ‚Üí E2E):

- **Speed decreases**
- **Confidence increases**

Use this trade-off to design a testing strategy that gives you the **most value** for your time and resources.

---

## üéØ Strategy Advice

- Use **unit tests** for fast feedback while coding and refactoring.
- Use **integration tests** where units interact closely (e.g. services + UI).
- Use **E2E tests** sparingly to validate the full user experience.
- Don‚Äôt fall into extremes. There‚Äôs no universal formula.

> Like choosing between dress shoes and running shoes ‚Äî it depends on where you're going.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Vitest

Easily add Vitest to your project in just a few steps:

---

### üì• 1. Install Vitest

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm i -D vitest
```

- The `-D` flag installs Vitest as a **development dependency**.
- This keeps your test tools out of your production bundle.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Add a Test Script

In your `package.json`, add the following to the `"scripts"` section:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "vitest"
}
```

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 3. Run Your Tests

Now you can run your tests with:

```bash
npm test
# or
npm t
```

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Your First Test

Let's write your very first test!

1. **Create a file:**  
   In your project root, add a new file:  
   `test/intro.test.js`

> Vitest automatically detects files with `test` in their name.

---

### üÖ∞Ô∏èüÖ∞Ô∏èüÖ∞Ô∏è The AAA Pattern

Most tests follow the **AAA** pattern:

1. **Arrange** ‚Äì Set up any necessary data or configuration.
2. **Act** ‚Äì Perform the action you want to test.
3. **Assert** ‚Äì Check that the outcome matches your expectations.

#### Example (Testing a TV Power Button):

- **Arrange:** The TV is turned on.
- **Act:** Press the power button.
- **Assert:** The TV should now be off.

# Code-First vs Test-First (TDD) ‚Äî A Step-by-Step Walk-through

---

## 1. Two Ways to Write Tests

| Approach       | Sequence                                                         | Nickname                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Code First** | 1. Write application code ‚Üí 2. Add tests afterward               | ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve done so far‚Äù          |
| **Test First** | 1. Write tests ‚Üí 2. Write just enough code to pass ‚Üí 3. Refactor | **TDD = Test-Driven Development** |

---

## 2. TDD‚Äôs Three-Step Cycle

1. **Red** ‚Äì Write a **failing** test.
2. **Green** ‚Äì Write the **simplest code** that makes the test pass.
3. **Refactor** ‚Äì Improve the design while keeping all tests green.
   - Loop back to step 1 and repeat.

---

## 3. TDD in Action ‚Äì `calculateAverage()` Example

> Goal: create a function that returns the average of an array of numbers.

---

## 4. Benefits of TDD

- **100 % test coverage** for every execution path produced.
- **Prevents over-engineering** ‚Äî you implement only what the failing test demands.
- **Continuous safety net** for fearless refactoring.

---

## 5. Real-World Caveats

- **Learning curve**: writing tests first feels awkward at first.
- **Complex domains**: crafting the very first test can be hard when requirements are fuzzy.
- **Not one-size-fits-all**: many teams happily adopt a hybrid (write-some-code, write-a-test) workflow.

---

## 6. Takeaways

- **TDD is a philosophy, not a religion.** Adopt when it boosts clarity and confidence; skip when it slows discovery.
- **Code First isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù** If you prefer to prototype quickly and add tests afterward, that‚Äôs valid.
- **Experiment.** Practice TDD on small utilities (like `calculateAverage`) to build muscle memory before tackling large apps.
